# About IIR 2025

The purpose of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop (IIR) is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Information Retrieval, where researchers (especially young ones), and other academic and industrial players interested in IR research can network and discuss their research results in an informal way. 

Traditionally IIR has been a focal point for the Italian Information Retrieval community, but it strongly encourages and welcomes participation from international researchers to enrich and expand collaborative opportunities.

IIR 2025 is the 15th edition of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop. It will take place in September 2025 at the University of Cagliari ([https://www.unica.it/](https://www.unica.it/)).

## Registration

Participation in the IIR 2025 workshop will be free of charge. However, advance registration will be strictly required.
